# overleaf-research-manuscript

This is an example repository used to illustrate some research workflows that can be implemented using GitHub Actions. Overleaf's GitHub synchronization feature allows the overleaf-research-manuscript repository to be synchronized with an Overleaf project.

The accompanying repository overleaf-research-workspace contains raw data and scripts, as well as the latest version of the compiled manuscript, accessibility reports, and other artifacts.
